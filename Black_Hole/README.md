## Introduction

This project implements a C++ simulation of a black hole based on classical and relativistic physics models.
It explores the behavior of test particles near a Schwarzschild black hole by numerically solving equations of motion under strong gravitational fields.
The simulation focuses on orbital instability, event horizon behavior, and energy conservation under extreme spacetime curvature.

This project is built for learning, experimentation, and future extensions into relativistic and quantum gravity models.
