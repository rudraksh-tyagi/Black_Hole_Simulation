This repository contains a C++ implementation of classical orbital mechanics, simulating the motion of a test object under Earth’s gravitational field.

The project numerically models object trajectories using Newtonian gravity and explores stable and unstable orbits, energy conservation, and trajectory evolution over time.

This work is intended as a foundational physics simulation, designed to later extend toward strong-gravity systems such as black holes by progressively introducing relativistic corrections.
